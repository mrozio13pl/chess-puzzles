king and newly promoted queen} 2. Ne3+ Kf3 3. Nxf1) 2. {White has to sacrifice his
bishop} Ne3 Ke2 3. Ke7 3... h4 4. Kf6 h3 5. Bf4 h2 {White will have
to take h2 pawn and lost the defender of the knight which black can take
immediately and promote the pawn as white's bishop can not stop it.} 6. Bxh2 Kxe3) 1... Kf3 2. Nf1 Ke2 3. Nh2

Kf4 7. Kh5 Kg3 8. Nf1+ Kg2 9. Ne3+ Kg3 10. Nf1+ {Black has to still protect his pawn on h4, but white can always respond with check, and if black tries to stay on h3, white can just waste a move with for example knight d2, because black's position is now frozen.})) 5. {The only move is Kf6,
because if now black's pawn tries to advance white will easily stop it, because
the knight is not only blocking pawn on h5 and f2 but also blocking black's king
escaping squares} Kf6 (5. Kg7 {If Kg7 white has no way to stop black's pawn on h5,
black will trade f2 pawn for the knight by promoting it and white can't stop
blacks h5 pawn} f1=Q 6. Nxf1
