{In this position black is up a rook and 3 pawns for a bishop and if white
doesn't do anything black will start an attack. White has a few checks, but a
move like queen e4 check just allows black to block with check, so the only
option left is bishop check.} 1. Bf5+ {Bishop f5 is the only move.} 1... Kg8
{Now, we have to realize that every move has to be a check, otherwise black will
start a deadly attack. We also need to realize if we let black escape the cage
and get to the center, black's pieces will be able to defend the king. Queen d8
check allows black's queen to block the check and white's attack will not work.
It seems that white's attack is hopeless.} ({Now blocking the check simply
allows mate in just 2 moves.} 1... g6+ 2. Bxg6+ Kg8 3. Qh8#) 2. Nxh6+ {But white
